# Web folder

This folder contains any assets needed for web builds of the application.

### WebError.hx

This is the equivalent of the desktop exceptions. It's pretty much the "We can't continue, you should refresh." screen.

### WebNotice.hx

The less... Crashy. Version of WebError. This just displays a message with a 5-second timeout before you can continue.

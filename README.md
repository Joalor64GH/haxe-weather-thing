# haxe-weather-thing 

An application made in HaxeFlixel that can give you the weather using [WeatherAPI](https://weatherapi.com).

## Compiling on your PC

Interested in compiling on your own PC? Cool. Just visit the md file [here](Documents/Building.md) to get started.

## Using the application

As of v0.0.1, the most basic functions are implemented in the app: A search substate and API calls for the searching for the location you specify. However, I'm still working out bugs.
